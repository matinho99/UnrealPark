# UnrealPark

This project was my first dive into Unreal Engine 4 landscaping. I have chosen a design of a park as a subject. The work for this project included:
- working in Landscape mode and using Sculpt tools to model the landcape
- creating a Material using Layer blends with multiple textures and working with Landscape Paint tools to apply material layers to the landscape
- adding Foliage to the landscape, e.g. bushes, grass, sticks
- using external package's assets to enrich the park's content
